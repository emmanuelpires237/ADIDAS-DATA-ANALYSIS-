# ADIDAS SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS 

**1.Project Overview**

This project involved developing a comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI to track and analyze key business metrics across different dimensions such as retailers, regions, product categories, and sales methods.
The dashboard provides real-time insights into total sales, operating profits, and units sold, empowering management to make data-driven strategic decisions that enhance profitability, optimize sales channels, and identify high-performing products and markets.
The goal was to create a visually dynamic, interactive, and data-rich reporting tool that could summarize complex datasets into actionable business insights.

**2.Project Scope**

The scope of the project covered the full analytics lifecycle — from data acquisition and cleaning, through data modeling and visualization, to the delivery of an interactive, user-friendly Power BI dashboard.
Key focus areas included:
* Tracking year-over-year sales and profit performance
* Comparing sales by retailer, product, and region
* Analyzing operating profits by sales method (Online, Outlet, In-store)
* Identifying top-performing states and categories
* Monitoring monthly sales trends and KPI performance
This scope ensured the business could not only assess overall performance but also pinpoint growth opportunities and underperforming segments.
