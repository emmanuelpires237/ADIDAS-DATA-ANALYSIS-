# ADIDAS SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS 

**1.Project Overview**

This project involved developing a comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI to track and analyze key business metrics across different dimensions such as retailers, regions, product categories, and sales methods.
The dashboard provides real-time insights into total sales, operating profits, and units sold, empowering management to make data-driven strategic decisions that enhance profitability, optimize sales channels, and identify high-performing products and markets.
The goal was to create a visually dynamic, interactive, and data-rich reporting tool that could summarize complex datasets into actionable business insights.

**2.Project Scope**

The scope of the project covered the full analytics lifecycle — from data acquisition and cleaning, through data modeling and visualization, to the delivery of an interactive, user-friendly Power BI dashboard.
Key focus areas included:
* Tracking year-over-year sales and profit performance
* Comparing sales by retailer, product, and region
* Analyzing operating profits by sales method (Online, Outlet, In-store)
* Identifying top-performing states and categories
* Monitoring monthly sales trends and KPI performance
This scope ensured the business could not only assess overall performance but also pinpoint growth opportunities and underperforming segments.

**3.Methodology**

**A structured and iterative data analytics methodology was followed:**

**1.	Data Extraction & Cleaning** – Imported datasets from multiple retail and e-commerce channels, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

**2.	Data Transformation** – Applied Power Query transformations to handle null values, normalize data, and create calculated columns/measures (e.g., profit margins, YoY growth).

**3.	Data Modeling** – Built a star schema with key relationships between fact tables (sales, profit) and dimension tables (product, retailer, region).

**4.	Visualization Design** – Designed dashboards emphasizing clarity, interactivity, and storytelling, using color coding and slicers for intuitive navigation.

**5.	KPI Definition** – Developed and visualized business-critical KPIs for easy monitoring and comparison.

**6. Performance Optimization** – Used DAX optimization and query reduction for faster dashboard performance.



**4.Data Source**

**The data used originated from:**

* Company Sales Records (2020–2021)
* Retailer transaction logs (West Gear, Foot Locker, Walmart, etc.)
* Regional sales summaries and product category breakdowns
* Online and offline sales channels
Data was consolidated into a single analytical model to enable cross-dimensional analysis



**5.Tools Used**

* Microsoft Power BI* – For dashboard creation, modeling, and interactive visualization.
* Microsoft Excel – For initial data cleaning, validation, and exploratory analysis.
* Power Query & DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For data transformation and creating calculated KPIs.
* Canva / PowerPoint (Optional) – For final presentation and reporting design.
